# Onboarding for new researchers

Modern researchers require a diverse set of skills. Many of these are topic-specific and are well-taught by senior researchers. However, in this modern research world that is shifting from analog to digital scholarly research new skills are required. These include knowledge about pre-registration, basic copyright, and much more. This is where this project comes in.
