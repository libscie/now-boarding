<h1 id="preprints">Preprints</h1>
<p>Preprints are versions of a manuscript before they have passed peer-review. At which stage you share a version of a manuscript as a preprint, is up to you. A preprint can be the submitted manuscript after extensive revisions with your co-authors or a completed draft that your co-authors are reviewing but you want more diverse feedback on (or anything in between). When a manuscript has passed peer-review and you want to share it, it is often called a <a href="postprints.md">postprint</a>.</p>
<p>Sharing preprints helps decrease artificial delays in sharing of results, that <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150701055009/http://blog.dhimmel.com/plos-and-publishing-delays/">easily run into months and sometimes even years</a> in the traditional back and forth between peer-reviewers, editors, and authors. Of course, sharing results too soon is a worry, but that also applies to when results are presented at conferences. Sharing results too late is also a worry for scholarly research, which is why preprints are helpful.</p>
<p>Manuscripts can be shared in various ways, but are only considered preprints when they can be (1) cited specifically based on their version, (2) stored in a stable manner, and (3) are indexed to increase findability. Because preprints are subject to revisions, it is important that citations of preprints refer to the specific version. This helps remove potential confusing citations due to changing content. Moreover, when stored on a personal homepage, it is easy for a link to break (see also <a href="reference-rot.md">&quot;Reference Rot&quot;</a>) and subsequently makes it impossible to verify a citation. Also, in order to help other people discover your work, preprints are indexed by for example <a href="google-scholar.md">Google Scholar</a>.</p>
<p>There are many places where preprints can be and are shared, but some of the most well known include <a href="https://arxiv.org">arXiv</a> and <a href="https://biorxiv.org">bioRxiv</a>. Which one suits your needs depends on your field and audience. A comprehensive (but not exhaustive) collection is curated by Martyn Rittman <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17RgfuQcGJHKSsSJwZZn0oiXAnimZu2sZsWp8Z6ZaYYo/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<p>Sharing preprints is a good first step to promoting timely access to your work, but it is also important to be clear about what others may do to help you redistribute your work. For more information on that, read about <a href="licensing.md">&quot;Licensing&quot;</a>.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you have published before, try to find out how long it took you from submission to publication. If you have not published yourself, ask one of your colleagues who has.</li>
<li>Ask yourself or your colleague how the peer review process was like and whether it would have been unwise to share the manuscript earlier (with hindsight).</li>
<li>Go through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17RgfuQcGJHKSsSJwZZn0oiXAnimZu2sZsWp8Z6ZaYYo/edit?usp=sharing">list of preprint servers</a> and decide which ones would be applicable for your work and intended audience.</li>
<li>Talk with your direct supervisors or colleagues about what level of preprint sharing you'd be comfortable committing to for future manuscripts.</li>
