# Reference rot

Reference rot occurs when a link to a Webpage either does not work anymore (called link rot) or when different content is presented on that page than was originally referred to (called content drift). [One out of five scholarly articles](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0115253) and [over 70% of all Weblinks in legal](http://web.archive.org/web/20180117215147/https://harvardlawreview.org/2014/03/perma-scoping-and-addressing-the-problem-of-link-and-reference-rot-in-legal-citations/) contain reference rot; age of a Weblink increases the probability of reference rot.

The Web is a dynamic place, which for day-to-day purposes is exactly what we want. Newspages change daily, while you visit the same addres; social media sites are personalized despite following the same link. However, for scholarly purposes, this poses a problem exactly because references are **not** stable and are uncertain to be exactly that what was referred to. If you refer to an online news article in a manuscript, it might be there today but it can be edited or deleted at any time. When that happens, nobody can verify what you referenced. 

Citing scholarly articles tackle this issue with the [Digital Object Identifier (DOI)](doi.md); for Webpages the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) provides the [Wayback Machine](https://wayback.archive.org). The [Wayback Machine](https://wayback.archive.org/) makes a snapshot of a webpage and provides you with a datestamped link you can use to cite the page exactly as you saw it. The Internet Archive has been around [since 1996 and already contains hundreds of billions of Webpages](https://archive.org/about/). Moreover, whenever you take a snapshot other people can view that history too if they ever need to for some reason. You can also see how that page changed over time. Another another archival service is [Perma.cc](https://perma.cc).

## Exercises

* What kinds of references do you use that could be subject to reference rot? Think about blogs, newsposts, tweets, etc.
* View [this](https://perma.cc/7CN8-NJNV) archived website using [Perma.cc](https://perma.cc) and also fire up the live page. Does the page still exist, and if so, does it have the same content?
<!--Might add a really fun example at some point where the page first says really nonobvious results and in the live version it has been adjusted -->
* Have you ever stumbled upon a reference to a Webpage in an article that didn't work? How did that affect the claims made in that article?
* Have you ever heard about this issue before? Do you think it is going to affect more or less content in the future?
