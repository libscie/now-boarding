# Preprints

Preprints are versions of a manuscript before they have passed peer-review. What version you share as a preprint, is up to you. This can be the submitted manuscript after extensive revisions with your co-authors or a completed draft that your co-authors are reviewing but you want more diverse feedback on (or anything in between). When a manuscript has passed peer-review and you want to share it, it is often called a [postprint](postprint.md).

Sharing preprints helps decrease artificial delays in sharing of results, that easily run into months and sometimes even years in the traditional back and forth between peer-reviewers, editors, and authors. Of course, sharing results too soon is a worry, but that also applies to when results are presented at conferences. Sharing results too late is also a worry, which is why preprints are helpful.

Manuscripts can be shared in various ways, but are only considered preprints when they can be (1) cited specifically based on their version, (2) stored in a stable manner, and (3) are indexed to increase findability. Because preprints are subject to revisions, it is important that citations of preprints refer to the specific version to remove the possibility of confusing citations due to changing content. This often results in different identifiers for 

There are many places to share preprints, but some of the most well known include [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) and [bioRxiv](https://biorxiv.org). Which one suits your needs depends on your field and audience, but there are many preprint servers that are indexed by for example [Google Scholar](google-scholar.md).

Sharing preprints is a good first step to promoting timely access to your work, but it is also important to be clear about what others may do to help you redistribute your work. For more information on that, read about ["Licensing"](licensing.md).

## Exercises

* If you have published before, try to find out how long 
* Talk with your direct supervisors or colleagues about what level of preprint sharing you'd be comfortable committing to. There is no right or wrong, because this is an ongoing discussion.
