<div id='container'>
<div id="col1">
<p>Publication bias is the selective publication of research results on an arbitrary judgement. Such arbitrary judgements (can) vary across individuals, over time, and remain undisclosed to those who are not privy to the decision process. Publication bias distorts the complete picture of research results and by extension threatens the validity of results, theories, and effectivity of interventions. For example, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s41073-016-0017-4">less than half of all registered clinical trials on breast cancer are published</a> for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>The most well-known form of publication bias is based on statistical significance: Significant results (p &lt; .05; sometimes called positive results) have a higher probability of getting submitted- and accepted for publication than nonsignificant results (sometimes called null or negative results). Other forms of publication bias can include higher publication probabilities for results that confirm prior beliefs or research that uses common methods because they're better understood.</p>
<p>Selective publication can be with intent, but can also be unconscious. Intentional selectivity can occur when there is a <a href="conflict-of-interest.md">Conflict of interest</a>. For example, a policy research institute might be commissioned to do research for a company that pressures them to show specific results only. Unconscious selectivity can occur due to implicit assumptions in the quality of a study. For example, publication bias based on statistical significance is often the result of an implicit assumption that study quality is somehow based on the results that study produces. Biases are complex and might join both intentional and unconscious selectivity because of the many people involved in research.</p>
<p>Publication bias can occur at many stages in the research process and can be outside of the control of the authors. For instance, the bias can occur directly after data are collected and results are known. When statistically nonsignificant results are considered to invalidate a method, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1255484">authors often do not even submit the manuscript</a>. At a later stage, if the manuscript is submitted, publication bias can occur in the decision by editors and the assessment by the reviewers.</p>
<p>There are several ways to prevent publication bias, which include communicating research designs publicly before results are available (see also <a href="preregistration.md">Preregistration</a>. With the Web, individuals have the possibility to share all their planned studies easily. Some journals have started accepting <a href="registered-reports.md">Registered reports</a> in order to prevent publication bias based on reviewer biases on statistical significance.</p>

<h1 id="exercises">Exercises</h1>
<ul>
<li>What are common reasons in your field for results not being published? Do any of these show any indication of bias instead of a quality check? (Hint: It is good to discuss this with a colleague over coffee!)</li>
<li>Have you evaluated a study design differently based on the results? Why?</li>
<li>Does publication bias affect the field of research you read on?</li>
<li>Considering publication bias can affect the validity of results, what steps do you consider worthwhile to reduce selective publication in your own projects?</li>
<li>Talk to your direct supervisors or colleagues about how publication bias affects your research field and try to figure out what level of commitment you feel comfortable with.</li>
