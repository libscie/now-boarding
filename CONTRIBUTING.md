# Contribution guidelines

This is an inclusive project and aims to respect all human beings that participate in it. All contributions are evaluated in light of the code of conduct and intolerant contributions are not tolerated, regardless of how ingenious you might find them. So please, [read the code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md) to prevent grievances down the line. If you do not agree to respect other people, please do not contribute.

More specific contribution guidelines are:

* By contributing content to this project, you agree that your content will be licensed under a [CC 0 Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode). 
* All pull requests will be reviewed by at least one person to ensure that it is suitable to merge the content. Please understand that you might need to make revisions and that giving feedback might take some time (we try to communicate what to expect).
* We value accessibility of the content and therefore actively encourage contributors to simplify their language (this also makes it easier to translate content in the future).
* For accessibility reasons, please refrain from being excessively wordy and focus on bringing the message across in a clear and succinct manner.
* Any contributions are appreciated, so there is no need to pressure yourself with contributing large amounts or perfect content. As maintainers and contributors, we can facilitate each other ðŸ™‹
